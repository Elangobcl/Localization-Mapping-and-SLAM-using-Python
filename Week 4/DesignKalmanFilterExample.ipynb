    "## Conclusion\n",
    "1. Playing with Kalman Filter in simulation is easy. You know the $Q$ and you know the $R$\n",
    "2. In practice, such evaluations with simulated as well as real data will help driving the choice of matrices\n",
    "3. Experimenting with order of filter and confirming that filter doesn't diverge can be done offline or online\n",
    "4. The end result is often that the Kalman filter is an inexact model of the system. This inexactness causes suboptimal behavior, which in the worst case causes the filter to diverge completely.\n",
    "5. If the Kalman filter is performing optimally its estimation errors will have following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "   a. The mean of the estimation error is zero\n",
    "   \n",
    "   b. The covariance is described by Kalman Filter's covariance matrix "
